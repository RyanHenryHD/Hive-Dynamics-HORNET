This is a DeepSort project used for a drone project. At the moment I am just using deep-sort-realtime 1.3.2 but I am currently working on my own version. Using Sort methods such as: Kalman filter, Bounding box matching (IoU), 
Hungarian Alrorithm and Deep methods such as CNN for apperance similarity.
